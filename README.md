# Jurodedu Neoforged (v3)
The third remake of Jurodedu; a Minecraft modpack revolving around both having fun and an operational computer.

Previously, Jurodedu v2 ran on Fabric 1.20.1. Major version 3 introduces 1.21.1 support (also dropping 1.20.1 support) and more mods.

The latter objective of Jurodedu still remains my focus - the modpack can run smoothly on 2GB of RAM for a singleplayer world, 4 gigabytes or more will be plenty enough for multiplayer with players all over the map.
